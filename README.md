### A Web-base Application, Designed to display and store recipes. 

![What's Cookin Welcome Page](src/images/Whats-Cooking-Welcome-Page.png)

This application is part of Turing's Module 2 curriculum. This project aims to use the Fetch API to send requests for information regarding various users, recipes, and ingredients. Using that information, our application would create a website showing a list of recipes, including icons to display what those recipes looked like. Clicking on a recipe expands the recipe's information, showing the ingredients needed, how much all those ingredients cost, and the instructions needed to create that recipe. Finally, users can save a selected recipe to their own list through a simple button press. Saved recipes can be access through the sidebar.
